# BEAST Output Scraper


Quick and dirty Python script to scrape all the info from a BEAST log into a csv file.


BEAST is a software developed for the University of Leeds for the COMP5400M module.


# File Structure
* scaper.py
Takes all the info out of the txt dump and formats it in a csv so we can plot it.
Might use matplotlib later, or just do the plotting in MATLAB.


* BeastPlotter.m 
Takes the csv outputted by the scaper script and plots is.
